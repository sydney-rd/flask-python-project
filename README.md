# Flask Python Project
A project showing how to use Flask and PeeWee to create endpoints and routes while accessing databases. 

In this project, I have created a new table, Candy, that displays multiple types of candy utilizing my model.

# Routes

* /candy/ can be used for GET and POST endpoints
* /candy/id can be used for GET, PUT, and DELETE endpoints

# Endpoints

* GET: will retrieve all the candy data
* POST: will create a new candy member of the Candy class
* PUT: will update a current candy member utilzing its ID
* DELETE: will delete a candy member by its ID
